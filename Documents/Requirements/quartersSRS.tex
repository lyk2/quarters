\section{Project Drivers}
\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
\subsubsection{Project Background}
Communication is the exchange of information between two parties. It is an important aspect of people's everyday lives. With the introduction 
of the Internet and mobile devices people's capacity to communicate has vastly 
improved, however, this information has hardly centralized. Landlords and their 
tenants commonly communicate via email, instant messaging or phone calls, but a response is not always guaranteed or the reply is hard to retrace. This lack of centralized 
communication may introduce confusion and frustration between the two parties in addition to challenges sharing documents and other important information.\\

\noindent Developing a new software platform to serve as an intermediate between 
landlords and tenants to act as a centralized hub of information will improve 
the quality of communication and create a more functional living environment 
for the occupants.

\subsubsection{Project Goal}
This platform is designed to handle information between landlords and their 
tenants, as well as between other tenants. It efficiently and systemically 
handles communication between all parties and gives a detailed status of the household.

\subsection{The Client, the Customer, and Other Stakeholders}
\subsubsection {The Client}
  N/A.
\subsubsection {The Customer}
This platform is designed for tenants and landlords. It provides tenants with the ability to communicate efficiently and effectively with each other and their landlord. The customer requires a robust, easy-to-learn platform.
\subsubsection {Other Stakeholders}
Other stakeholders whose input is needed to build the product include the project supervisor to provide guidance and advice on the design and implementation, current software developers to create and test the application and future software developers to improve and build on the existing version.
\subsection{Users of the Product}
There are two key users of the product: tenants and landlords. From herein, the term "user" encompasses both a tenant and landlord, unless otherwise specified. \\ \\
Tenants have the following role:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Communicate information to other tenants when needed
\item Complete the chores assigned to them
\item Report maintenance issues in the house via the ticketing system
\item Be punctual with payments
\item Ensure the rules outlined for the house are followed
\item 18+ years old
\item Basic web browsing experience required
\end{enumerate}
Landlords have the following role:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Communicate information regarding the house to the tenants
\item Respond to tenant questions and inquiries
\item Complete maintenance requests within a timely manner
\item Be available when issues arise
\item 18+ years old
\item Basic web browsing experience required
\end{enumerate}


\section{Project Constraints}

\section{Naming Conventions and Terminology}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item House: In the context of this project, a house functions as a set
      which contains one or more users and stores information about the
      physical property, the users, and content added by those users.
    \item User: A user is a user of the application. A user is designated as an administrator or member of a house.
    \item Administrator: The user that creates the house is, by default, the administrator of the house. The administrator of a house is the only member of the house who can change information about the house, upload/delete files, add/delete members, and delete the house.
    \item Maintenance request: A ticket created by a member of a house to inform another member of the same house of property-related maintenance that needs to be addressed.
    \end{itemize}

\section{Relevant Facts and Assumptions} 
\subsection{Relevant Facts}
N/A.
\subsection{Assumptions}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item  It is assumed that both landlords and tenants will be capable of using
    web applications for communication, planning, and payments.
  \end{itemize} 

\section{Functional Requirements} 
\subsection{The Scope of the Work}
\subsubsection{The Current Situation}
There is currently no existing software platform that attempts to simplify and 
document communication between landlords and tenants. A web application is 
needed to serve as a centralized management solution that will benefit both 
types of users. The web application will include document storage, financial transaction history, a calendar, maintenance ticketing, and a 
bulletin board.
\subsubsection{The Context of the Work}
