\section{Project Drivers}
\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
\subsubsection{Project Background}
Communication is the exchanging of information between one party to another 
one. It is an important aspect of people's everyday lives. With the introduction 
of the Internet and cellular devices people's capacity to communicate has vastly 
increased, however, this information has hardly centralized. Landlords and their 
tenants commonly communicate via email or text messages, but a response is not 
guaranteed or the reply is hard to retrace. This lack of centralized 
information may introduce discrepancies between the two parties and hardships 
upon getting documents and other vital information.\\

\noindent Developing a new software platform to serve as an intermediate between 
landlords and tenants to act as a centralized hub of information will improve 
the quality of communication and create a more functional living environment 
for the occupants.

\subsubsection{Project Goal}
This platform is designed to handle information between landlords and their 
tenants, as well as between other tenants. It will efficiently and systemically 
handle requests from both parties and give a detailed status of the household.

\subsection{The Client, the Customer, and Other Stakeholders}
\subsubsection {The Client}
  N/A
\subsubsection {The Customer}
This platform is targeted for tenants and landlords as they will be the 
primary users of the software. With this implementation, tenants will be 
able to communicate efficiently with each other and their landlord. This target 
audience will require an easy to learn service that is robust enough to handle 
any cases that occur.
\subsubsection {Other Stakeholders}
There are several other stakeholders than can provide valuable insight 
to the product. These people and organizations include:
\begin{itemize}
\item Business analysts can collect and analyse the potential data.
\item Plumbers and electricians can provide information directly to the main 
stakeholders with respect to 
solving maintenance issues in the house.
\item Legal experts can protect the users and developers from unlawful acts.
\item Developers are required to create and test the platform.
\item Marketing experts can suggest advertising strategies.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Users of the Product}
There are two key users of the product: tenants and landlords. \\ \\
Tenants are responsible for the following actions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Communicate information to other tenants when needed
\item Complete the chores assigned to them
\item Report maintenance issues in the house via the ticketing system
\item Be punctual with payments
\item Ensure the rules outlined for the house are followed
\end{enumerate}
Landlord are responsible for the following actions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Communicate information regarding the house to the tenants
\item Respond to tenant questions and inquiries
\item Complete maintenance requests within a timely manner
\item Be available when issues arise
\end{enumerate}


\section{Project Constraints}
\subsection{Mandated Constraints} 
\begin{description}
  \item[Solution Constraints] \hfill \\

\section{Functional Requirements} 
\subsection{The Scope of the Work}
\subsubsection{The Current Situation}
There is currently no existing software platform that attempts to simplify and 
document communication between landlords and tenants. A web application is 
needed to serve as a centralized management solution that will benefit both 
types of users. The web application will include document storage, in-app 
payment, a chore calendar, maintenance ticketing, instant messaging, and a 
discussion board.  
\subsubsection{The Context of the Work}
