\section{Project Drivers}
\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
\subsubsection{Project Background}
Communication, the idea of exchanging information between one party to another 
one is an important aspect of people's everyday lives. With the introduction 
of Internet and cellular devices people's capacity to communicate has vastly 
increased, however this information hardly centralized. Landlords and their 
tenants commonly communicate via email or test messages, but a response is not 
guaranteed or the reply is hard to retrace.This lack of centralized 
information may introduce discrepancies between the two parties and hardships 
upon getting documents and other vital data.

Developing a new software platform to serve as an intermediate between 
landlords and tenants  as a centralized hub of information will improve 
the quality of communication and create a more functional living environment 
for the occupants.

\subsubsection{Project Goal}
This platform is designed to handle information between landlords and their 
tenants, as well as between other tenants. It will efficiently and systemically 
handle requests from both parties and give a detailed status of the household.

\subsection{The Client, the Customer, and Other Stakeholders}
\subsubsection {The Client}
  N/A
\subsubsection {The Customer}
This platform is targeted at tenants, and landlords as they will be the 
primary users of the software. With this implementation, tenants will be 
able to communicate efficiently with each other and their landlord. This target 
audience will require an easy to learn service that is robust enough to handle 
any cases that occur.
\subsubsection {Other Stakeholders}
There are an abundant of other stakeholders than can provide valuable insight 
towards the product. \\
These people/organizations include:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Business analyst can collect the potential data, and complete data 
analyse on it.
\item Plumbers, and electricians can also provide information directly to 
solving maintenance issues in the house.
\item Legal experts can protect the users and developers from unlawful acts.
\item Developers are required to create and test the platform.
\item Marketing Experts can provide beneficial tactics on how to advertise.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Users of the Product}
There are two key users that will be using this platform where these users are 
critical to the product, thus the requirements generated is heavily influenced 
by tenants and landlords.\\
Tenants are responsible for the following actions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item communicate information to other tenants when needed
\item to complete the chores assigned to them
\item report issues in the house via the ticketing system
\item be on time with payments
\item ensure the rules outlined for the house are followed
\end{enumerate}
Landlord are responsible for the following actions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item communicate information in regards to the house to the tenants
\item actively engage in discussion questions
\item diligently completing maintenance requests
\item be adequately available when issues arise
\end{enumerate}

\section{Functional Requirements} \cc{this section probs needs to be completed as a group}
\subsection{The Scope of the Work}
\subsubsection{The Current Situation}
There is currently no existing software platform that attempts to simplify and document communication between landlords and tenants. A web application is needed to serve as a centralized management solution that will benefit both types of users. The web application will include document storage, in-app payment, a calendar, instant messaging, and discussion boards.
