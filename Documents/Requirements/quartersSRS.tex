\subsection{The Scope of the Work}
\subsubsection{The Current Situation}
There is currently no existing software platform that attempts to simplify and document communication between landlords and tenants. A web application is needed to serve as a centralized management solution that will benefit both types of users. The web application will include document storage, in-app payment, a calendar, instant messaging, and discussion boards.
