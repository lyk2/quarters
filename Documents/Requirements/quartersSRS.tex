\section{Project Drivers}
\subsection{The Purpose of the Project}
\subsubsection{Project Background}
Communication, the idea of exchanging information between one party to another 
one is an important aspect of people's everyday lives. With the introduction 
of internet and cellular devices people's capacity to communicate has vastly 
increased, however this information hardly centralized. Landlords and their 
tenants commonly communicate via email or test messages, but a response is not 
guarenteed or the reply is hard to retrace.This lack of centralized 
information may introduce descrepencies between the two parties and hardships 
upon getting documents and other vital data.

Developing a new software platform to serve as an intermediate between 
landlords and tenants  as a centralized hub of information will improve 
the quality of communication and create a more functional living environment 
for the occupants.

\subsubsection{Project Goal}
This platform is designed to handle information between landlords and their 
tenants, as well as between other tenants. It will efficently and systemically 
handle requests from both parties and give a detailed status of the household.
