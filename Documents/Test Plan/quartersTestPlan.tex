%Plans for Automated Testing
\section{Plans for Automated Testing}
All tests that will be automated will be completed for the Final Demo April 1. We will automate testing for every feature, except financing, notification and chat. We will also test the integrity of the database using automated testing. We will also check if every page is reachable, to ensure there are no unhandled HTTP errors. We plan to run automated tests on a weekly basis, every Sunday night. Automated testing tools include Grunt, SinonJS and custom Python scripts. 

%Plans for Unit Testing
\section{Plans for Unit Testing}
All unit tests will be automated. Unit tests will be created as features are developed. They will be separated by module. Since the majority of modules will be Javascript, we will be using QUnit. QUnit is a Javascript unit testing framework. 

\ds{You should start planning your unit tests now. You can determine the
majority of them ahead of time.}

%System Tests
\section{System Tests}

%4.1 User Registration
\subsection{User Registration} 
\textbf{Test Type:} Functional, Dynamic, Automated. \\
\textbf{Tools Used:} Custom Scripts, Google reCAPTCHA. \\
\textbf{Schedule:} Begin testing November 8. Complete manual tests by PoC Demo November 16. Complete automated dynamic tests by Final Demo April 1. \\
\textbf{Team Member Responsible:} Carolyn Chong.\\
\textbf{Methodology:} The main objective of user registration is to create a user account to be used for login. Users must use a valid email address and pass a user identification procedure. This ensures the user is human and prevents spam and automated scripts from accessing the application and abusing its services. Testing is manual and automated. Manual testing involves people manually going through the registration process in real-time as a user. Automated testing involves systemically attempting SQL injections to test for valid and invalid registrations. Google reCAPTCHA validates that users are legitimate.

\begin{longtable}{|p{2cm}|p{3cm}|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Test Case}  & \textbf{Initial State} & \textbf{Input} & \textbf{Output} \\ \hline
1.1 & Landing page. Empty fields. & Email and password entered and passes reCAPTCHA test. Clicks register. & Verification email sent. Redirected to application main page. \\ 
\hline
1.2 & Landing page. Empty fields. & Empty field(s). Clicks register. & Stays on the same page. Error message appears. Empty field is highlighted. \\
\hline
1.3 & Landing page. Empty fields. & Email address already stored in database. Clicks register. & Stays on the same page. Error message appears. Email field is highlighted. \\
\hline
1.4 & Landing page. Empty fields. & Fails reCAPTCHA test. & Stays on the same page. Error message appears. Test field is highlighted. \\
\hline
\end{longtable}



%4.2 User Login
\subsection{User Login}
\textbf{Test Type:} Functional, Dynamic, Automated. \\
\textbf{Tools Used:} Custom Scripts. \\
\textbf{Schedule:} Begin testing November 8. Complete manual tests by PoC Demo November 16. Complete automated dynamic tests by Final Demo April 1. \\
\textbf{Team Member Responsible:} Carolyn Chong. \\
\textbf{Methodology:} The main objective of user login is to ensure a secure process where only valid users are allowed to enter the application. Testing involves authenticating users against an existing database to determine if they are valid users or not. Testing is automated. Automated testing involves systemically attempting SQL injections to test for valid and invalid logins.

\begin{longtable}{|p{2cm}|p{3cm}|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Test Case}  & \textbf{Initial State} & \textbf{Input} & \textbf{Output} \\ \hline
2.1 & Landing page. Empty username and password fields. & Valid username and password combination. Clicks login. & Redirected to application main page. \\ 
\hline
2.2 & Landing page. Empty username and password fields. & Invalid username and password combination. Clicks login. & Stays on the same page. Error message appears. Fields are highlighted. After 5 unsuccessful attempts, user cannot login for 10 minutes. \\
\hline
2.3 & Landing page. Empty username and password fields. & Empty username and/or password fields. Clicks login. & Stays on the same page. Error message appears. Fields are highlighted. \\
\hline
2.4 & Application main page. & Clicks logout. & User is successfully logged out from system. Redirected to login page. \\
\hline
2.5 & Landing page. Empty username and password fields. User attempting to login on another device while already logged in on a device. & Valid username and password combination. Clicks login. & Stays on the same page. Error message appears. \\ 
\hline
\end{longtable}



%4.3 Calendar
\subsection{Calendar}
\textbf{Test Type:} Functional, Dynamic, Automated. \\
\textbf{Tools Used:} Custom Scripts. \\
\textbf{Schedule:} Begin testing after the PoC Demo. Complete automated tests by Final Demo April 1. \\
\textbf{Team Member Responsible:} Carolyn Chong. \\
\textbf{Methodology:} The Calendar feature allows users to add/delete events and chores to a shared Calendar between members of a house. This shared Calendar can be synched with a user's personal Calendar. Testing is automated. Automated testing involves a script that will go through the process of adding/deleting an event or chore to the Calendar in real-time as a user, and then checking if those updates are properly synched with the user's personal Calendar. 

\begin{longtable}{|p{2cm}|p{3cm}|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Test Case}  & \textbf{Initial State} & \textbf{Input} & \textbf{Output} \\ \hline
3.1 & Calendar page. & Select date. & Form opens. \\ 
\hline
3.2 & Calendar page. Existing form is open. & User modifies event details and saves changes. & Form closes and updated Calendar is displayed. \\ 
\hline
3.3 & Calendar page. Empty form. & Add event/chore. Text entered in fields and saves. & Form closes. Event/chore is updated on Calendar. \\ 
\hline
3.4 & Calendar page. Empty form. & Add event/chore. Empty field(s). Clicks save. & Form remains open. Error message appears. Empty fields are highlighted. \\
\hline
3.5 & Calendar page. & Click to delete event/chore. & Event/chore is no longer displayed on Calendar. \ds{Who can delete events/chores?} \\

\textbf{Tools Used:} QUnit, Chron Scripts. \ds{Chron scripts?}\\
\textbf{Schedule:} Begin testing after the PoC Demo. Complete automated tests by Final Demo April 1. \\
\textbf{Team Member Responsible:} Kevin Ly. \\
\textbf{Methodology:} The maintenance tracking system allows tenants to create maintenance requests, where the landlord then responds and updates with further information. This portion of the system is restricted based on the user type; tenants cannot modify maintenance ticket properties. This component will be tested using unit tests for functionality, with automated testing to ensure the permissions are handled properly. Static database checkers will be used in conjunction with the automated test cases to check for proper database modifications.

\begin{longtable}{|p{2cm}|p{3cm}|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Test Case}  & \textbf{Initial State} & \textbf{Input} & \textbf{Output} \\ \hline

%5. Non-Functional Tests
\section{Non-Functional Tests}

\subsection{Usability}
This section describes a test plan for conducting a usability test for the Quarters application. 

\subsubsection{Participants}
The participants' responsibilities were to attempt to complete a set of representative task scenarios presented to them in as efficient and timely a manner as possible, and to provide feedback regarding the usability and acceptability of the user interface.  The participants were directed to provide honest opinions regarding the usability of the application, and to participate in a post-session subjective questionnaire.\\ \\
Eight participants, who were tenants themselves, were selected from Thode library at McMaster University. Four females and four males participated as tenants. They were between the ages of 18-22 years old. Participants were recruited by approaching students during day-time hours while they were studying. We recruited participants who were willing to use either their personal laptop or mobile device and run the application on their web browser. Participants were given a background on the project and were told the methodology of the test. Participants were then asked if they would volunteer their time to participate. No certain skills and/or background were required, however, it was expected that participants were familiar with using a web browser on a computer. Additionally, two participants, who were landlords themselves, were approached and selected by Quarters developers as they were the current landlords of the developers.

\subsubsection{Training}
The participants received an overview of Quarters and written instructions of the usability test procedure. No training was delivered on how to use Quarters; only a link to the landing page was given. The test environment was that of where the user was located at the time of recruitment, since that was most convenient for participants. All tenant participants took the test seated at a table on the first floor of Thode library. The first floor of Thode Library is known to be loud relative to a typical library setting. All participants were surrounded by non-participants talking at a conversational noise level. The library was considered ‘busy’, as every seat at every table was occupied at the time of testing. Landlord participants took the test at the rental house, also seated, but in a quieter setting relative to the library.

\subsubsection{Procedure}
The participants used their own laptop or mobile device to complete the usability test. The only requirement was that they completed the test on either Chrome, Opera, Explorer, Firefox, or Safari. The participant’s interaction with Quarters was monitored by the facilitator seated beside the participant. \\ \\
The facilitator briefed the participants on Quarters and instructed the participant that they were evaluating the application, rather than the facilitator evaluating the participant. Participants were informed that participation was voluntary and that participation could cease at any time. The facilitator asked the participant if they had any questions. \\ \\
Participants completed a pretest demographic and background information questionnaire as part of Task 1. Then, the facilitator explained that the amount of time taken to complete the test task would be measured. Participants were instructed that exploratory behavior outside the task flow should not occur. At the start of each task, the participant read aloud the task description from the printed copy and began the task. Time-on-task began when the participant started each task. \\ \\
The facilitator instructed the participant to ‘think aloud’ so that a verbal record existed of their interaction with Quarters. The facilitator observed and recorded user behaviour and user comments in a text editor. \\ \\
Task 2a required the landlord participants to create an account, login, create a house, and then create a post on the bulletin board. The facilitator explained that the number of button clicks and the amount of time taken to complete the test task would be measured. \\ \\
Task 2b required the tenant participants to create an account, login, and then create a post on the discussion board. The facilitator explained that the number of button clicks and the amount of time taken to complete the test task would be measured. \\ \\
After all task scenarios were attempted, the participant completed the post-test satisfaction questionnaire as part of Task 3. 
Due to the range and extent of functionality provided in the application, and the short time for which each participant was available, the tasks were the most common and relatively complex of available functions. Furthermore, the tasks represent a high-level goal of the software, that is, the ability to effectively and efficiently communicate. The tasks were identical for all participants in each subset in the study. \\ \\
A sample of the usability test instructions and questionnaires given to participants is in the Appendix, labelled Figure \ref{fig:test}. 

\subsubsection{Success Metrics}
Success metrics were guided by task completion success rates, task completion times, and subjective evaluations.
Completion rate was the percentage of test participants who successfully completed Task 2. In other words, the completion rate represented the percentage of participants who, when they were finished with the specified task, had an output that was correct. If a participant required assistance in order to achieve a correct output then the task would not be scored as completed. A completion rate of 100\% was the goal for Task 2 in this usability test.\\ \\ 
Task completion time was the time to complete the task.  It was measured from the time the person began the task to the time he/she signaled completion. An average task completion time of less than 60 seconds was the goal for the task in this usability test. \\ \\
Subjective evaluations regarding ease of use and satisfaction were collected via a questionnaire.  The questionnaire utilized rating scales. This data was used to assess attitudes of the participants.


\subsection{Performance}
To test the server, we will do a load testing to make sure the server can handle 100 simultaneous requests.

\ds{How?}

\subsection{Security}
To test the security of the system, including file access, failed password attempts, SQL injections, and expired sessions, we will do manual testing.

\ds{Be more descriptive.}
