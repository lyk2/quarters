%Plans for Automated Testing
\section{Plans for Automated Testing}
Though some tests may be done manually for the PoC Demo, all tests will be automated for the Final Demo in April. We will write our own test scripts.


%Plans for Unit Testing
\section{Plans for Unit Testing}
QUnit will be used for unit testing. QUnit is a Javascript unit testing framework.

%4.1 User Registration
\subsection{User Registration} 
\textbf{Test Type:} Functional/Static/Dynamic/Manual/Automated. \\
\textbf{Test Factors:} Correctness, Reliability. \\
\textbf{Tools Used:} Google reCAPTCHA. \\
\textbf{Schedule:} Begin static testing November 6. Complete manual dynamic tests by PoC Demo November 16. Complete automated dynamic tests by Final Demo April 1. Testing for creating an account with Google or Facebook will be completed for the Final Demo April 1. \\
\textbf{Team Member Responsible:} \\
\textbf{Methodology:} The main objective of user registration is to create a user account to be used for login. Users must use a valid email address and pass a user identification procedure. This ensures the user is human and prevents spam and automated scripts from accessing the application and abusing its services. Alternatively, a user can create an account using an existing Google or Facebook account. Testing is manual and automated. Manual testing involves people manually going through the registration process in real-time as a user. Automated testing involves systemically attempting SQL injections to test for valid and invalid registrations. Google reCAPTCHA validates that users are legitimate.

\begin{longtable}{|p{2cm}|p{3cm}|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Test Case}  & \textbf{Initial State} & \textbf{Input} & \textbf{Output} \\ \hline

%4.2 User Login
\subsection{User Login}
\textbf{Test Type:} Functional/Static/Dynamic/Manual/Automated. \\
\textbf{Test Factors:} Correctness, Reliability. \\
\textbf{Tools Used:} \\
\textbf{Schedule:} Begin static testing November 6. Complete manual dynamic tests by PoC Demo November 16. Complete automated dynamic tests by Final Demo April 1. Testing for logging in with a Google or Facebook account will be completed for the Final Demo April 1. \\
\textbf{Team Member Responsible:} \\
\textbf{Methodology:} The main objective of user login is to ensure a secure process where only valid users are allowed to enter the application. Testing involves authenticating users against an existing database to determine if they are valid users or not. Testing is manual and automated. Manual testing involves people manually going through the login process in real-time as a user. Automated testing involves systemically attempting SQL injections to test for valid and invalid logins.

%4.3 Calendar
\subsection{Calendar}
\textbf{Test Type:} Functional/Static/Dynamic/Manual/Automated. \\
\textbf{Test Factors:} Learnability, Reliability. \\
\textbf{Tools Used:} \cc{todo}. \\
\textbf{Schedule:} Begin static testing November 6. Complete manual dynamic tests by PoC Demo November 16. Complete automated dynamic tests by Final Demo April 1. Tests for the syncing of a user's personal calendar will be completed for the Final Demo April 1. \\
\textbf{Team Member Responsible:} \\
\textbf{Methodology:} The Calendar feature allows users to add/delete events and chores to a shared Calendar between members of a house. This shared Calendar can be synched with a user's personal Calendar. Testing is manual and automated. Manual testing involves a person manually going through the process of adding/deleting an event or chore to the Calendar in real-time as a user, and then checking if those updates are properly synched with the user's personal Calendar. Automated testing involves unit testing each possible input.

\begin{longtable}{|p{2cm}|p{3cm}|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Test Case}  & \textbf{Initial State} & \textbf{Input} & \textbf{Output} \\ \hline

\textbf{Tools Used:} QUnit, Chron Scripts. \\
\textbf{Schedule:} Begin static testing November 6. Complete manual dynamic tests by PoC Demo November 16. Complete automated dynamic tests by Final Demo April 1. \\
\textbf{Team Member Responsible:} \\
\textbf{Methodology:} The maintenance tracking system allows tenants to create maintenance requests, where the landlord then responds and updates with further information. This portions of this system is restricted based on the user type; tenants cannot modify maintenance ticket properties. This component will be tested using unit test for functionality, with automated testing to ensure the permissions are handled properly. Static database checkers will be used in conjunction with the automated test cases to check for proper database modifications.

%4.9 Live chat
\subsection{Live Chat}
\textbf{Test Type:} Functional/Static/Dynamic/Manual/Automated. \\
\textbf{Test Factors:} Correctness, Reliability. \\
\textbf{Tools Used:} \\
\textbf{Schedule:} Begin static testing November 6. Complete manual dynamic tests by PoC Demo November 16. Complete automated dynamic tests by Final Demo April 1. \\
