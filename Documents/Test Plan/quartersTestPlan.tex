%Plans for Automated Testing
\section{Plans for Automated Testing}
All tests that will be automated will be completed for the Final Demo April 1. We will automate testing for every feature, except financing, notification and chat. We will also test the integrity of the database using automated testing. We will also check if every page is reachable, to ensure there are no un-handled HTTP errors. We plan to run automated tests on a weekly basis, every Sunday night. Automated testing tools include Grunt, SinonJS and custom Python scripts. 

%Plans for Unit Testing
\section{Plans for Unit Testing}
All unit tests will be automated. Unit tests will be created as features are developed. They will be separated by module. Since the majority of modules will be Javascript, we will be using QUnit. 

%System Tests
\section{System Tests}


%4.1 User Registration
\subsection{User Registration} 
\textbf{Test Type:} Functional, Dynamic, Automated. \\
\textbf{Tools Used:} Custom Scripts, Google reCAPTCHA. \\
\textbf{Schedule:} Begin testing November 8. Complete manual tests by PoC Demo November 16. Complete automated dynamic tests by Final Demo April 1. \\
\textbf{Team Member Responsible:} \\
\textbf{Methodology:} The main objective of user registration is to create a user account to be used for login. Users must use a valid email address and pass a user identification procedure. This ensures the user is human and prevents spam and automated scripts from accessing the application and abusing its services. Testing is manual and automated. Manual testing involves people manually going through the registration process in real-time as a user. Automated testing involves systemically attempting SQL injections to test for valid and invalid registrations. Google reCAPTCHA validates that users are legitimate.

\begin{longtable}{|p{2cm}|p{3cm}|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Test Case}  & \textbf{Initial State} & \textbf{Input} & \textbf{Output} \\ \hline
4.1.1 & Registration page. Empty fields. & Email and password entered and passes reCAPTCHA test. & Verification email sent. Redirected to application main page. \\ 
\hline
4.1.2 & Registration page. Empty fields. & Empty field(s). & Stays on the same page. Error message appears: "Please fill in missing fields". Empty field is highlighted. \\
\hline
4.1.3 & Registration page. Empty fields. & Email address already stored in database. & Stays on the same page. Error message appears. Email field is highlighted. \\
\hline
4.1.4 & Registration page. Empty fields. & Fails reCAPTCHA test. & Stays on the same page. Error message appears. Test field is highlighted. \\
\hline
\end{longtable}



%4.2 User Login
\subsection{User Login}
\textbf{Test Type:} Functional, Dynamic, Automated. \\
\textbf{Tools Used:} Custom Scripts. \\
\textbf{Schedule:} Begin testing November 8. Complete manual tests by PoC Demo November 16. Complete automated dynamic tests by Final Demo April 1. \\
\textbf{Team Member Responsible:} \\
\textbf{Methodology:} The main objective of user login is to ensure a secure process where only valid users are allowed to enter the application. Testing involves authenticating users against an existing database to determine if they are valid users or not. Testing is manual and automated. Manual testing involves people manually going through the login process in real-time as a user. Automated testing involves systemically attempting SQL injections to test for valid and invalid logins.

\begin{longtable}{|p{2cm}|p{3cm}|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Test Case}  & \textbf{Initial State} & \textbf{Input} & \textbf{Output} \\ \hline
4.2.1 & Login page. Empty username and password fields. \cc{break after 5 password failed attempts, logout timeout, online one device can login at a time} & Valid username and password combination. & Redirected to application main page. \\ 
\hline
4.2.2 & Login page. Empty username and password fields. & Invalid username. & Stays on the same page. Error message appears. Fields are highlighted. \\
\hline
4.2.3 & Login page. Empty username and password fields. & Valid username and invalid password. \cc{fix}. & Stays on the same page. Error message appears. Password field is highlighted. \\
\hline
4.2.4 & Login page. Empty username and password fields. & Empty username and/or password fields. & Stays on the same page. Error message appears. Fields are highlighted. \\
\hline
\end{longtable}



%4.3 Calendar
\subsection{Calendar}
\textbf{Test Type:} Functional, Dynamic, Automated. \\
\textbf{Tools Used:} Custom Scripts. \\
\textbf{Schedule:} Begin testing after the PoC Demo. Complete automated tests by Final Demo April 1. \\
\textbf{Team Member Responsible:} \\
\textbf{Methodology:} The Calendar feature allows users to add/delete events and chores to a shared Calendar between members of a house. This shared Calendar can be synched with a user's personal Calendar. Testing is manual and automated. Manual testing involves a person manually going through the process of adding/deleting an event or chore to the Calendar in real-time as a user, and then checking if those updates are properly synched with the user's personal Calendar. Automated testing involves \cc{todo}. \cc{Unit Testing?}.

\begin{longtable}{|p{2cm}|p{3cm}|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{Test Case}  & \textbf{Initial State} & \textbf{Input} & \textbf{Output} \\ \hline
4.3.1 & Calendar page. Empty form. & \cc{Add option to select date first, not allowed to make past event, modify event.} Add event/chore. Correct values entered in fields. & Form closes. Event/chore is added to database. Event/chore is updated on Calendar. \\ 
\hline
4.3.2 & Calendar page. Empty form. & Add event/chore. Incorrect values entered in fields. & Form remains open. Error message appears. Incorrect fields are highlighted. \\

%4.4 Maintenance Ticketing System
\subsection{Maintenance Tracking}
\textbf{Test Type:} Functional, Dynamic, Static, Automated. \\
\textbf{Tools Used:} QUnit, Chron Scripts. \\
\textbf{Schedule:} Begin testing after the PoC Demo. Complete automated tests by Final Demo April 1. \\
\textbf{Team Member Responsible:} \\
\textbf{Methodology:} The maintenance tracking system allows tenants to create maintenance requests, where the landlord then responds and updates with further information. This portion of the system is restricted based on the user type; tenants cannot modify maintenance ticket properties. This component will be tested using unit tests for functionality, with automated testing to ensure the permissions are handled properly. Static database checkers will be used in conjunction with the automated test cases to check for proper database modifications.

\begin{longtable}{|p{2cm}|p{3cm}|p{5cm}|p{5cm}|}

%5. Non-Functional Tests
\section{Non-Functional Tests}

\subsection{Look and Feel}
To test that the system is attractive and intuitive and appears professional and secure, we will survey 10 users to rate the user interface on a scale of 1 to 10, where a 1 means "ugly, unprofessional and would not return to the site", and a 10 means "captivating, professional, and would refer a friend". The testing schedule will include a test December 7 and February 22. The first test will be used as a baseline to get both quantitative and qualitative feedback. We will do a second test before the Final Demo to see if we improved.

\subsection{Usability}
To test that the system is intuitive to use and navigate, we will ask 10 users to create a user account and login. 5 users will act as landlords, who will send an email invitation to invite users to a house, and then create a post on the discussion board. 5 other users will act as tenants who will accept an email invitation, create an account, login, and then create a post on the discussion board. Users will rate their experience on a scale of 1 to 10, where a 1 is "frustrated, could not complete task(s), would not recommend", and a 10 means "user friendly, would recommend to a friend". The testing schedule will include a test December 7 and February 22. The first test will be used as a baseline to get both quantitative and qualitative feedback. We will do a second test before the Final Demo to see if we improved.

\subsection{Performance}
To test the server, we will do a load testing to make sure the server can handle 100 simultaneous requests.

\subsection{Security}
To test the security of the system, including file access, failed password attempts, SQL injections, and expired sessions, we will do manual testing.
