    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Frequently Asked Questions
    \section{Frequently Asked Questions}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{I forgot my password. What do I do?} \\
    If you have forgotten your password you can click the "Forgot my password" link below the ``LOG IN'' button. You will be requested to enter your email and a confirmation email to reset your password will be sent to your email account.
    \item \textbf{How do I change my password?} \\
    Head on over to User Profile settings. There you will find a field to change your password. You'll need to know your current password to make the change.
    \item \textbf{I am a tenant and a landlord, can I be both?} \\
    Yes! Of course you can, however, Quarters does not differentiate between tenants and landlords in terms of accessibility of features. Instead, users are either designated as basic members of a house, or as an administrator of a house. By default, whoever created the house is the administrator. But a house can have more than one administrator, so if you are a landlord, just send a message to your current administrator requesting administrative access. Check out what additional access Administrators get in the \hyperref[sec:conventions]{Naming Conventions and Terminology}
    \item \textbf{Can there be more than one administrator in a house?} \\
    Yes! Just send a message to your current administrator requesting administrative access.
    \item \textbf{Can I be a member of more than one house?} \\
    Totally! Check out the \hyperref[sec:housemanagement]{House Management}  section for instructions on how to create or join another house.
    \item \textbf{Is Quarters free?} \\
    You betcha!
    \item \textbf{How can I trust that members of my house only add legitimate bills?} \\
    As of now, Quarters doesn't yet have a solution preventing this from happening, so any discrepancies will have to be resolved via the discussion board.
    \end{enumerate}
