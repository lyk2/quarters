\title{Problem Statement for quarters}

\maketitle

The current technology used by landlords to communicate with their tenants is 
archaic and underdeveloped. Phone calls, emails, text messages and verbal 
messages are inefficient methods of communication. Landlords are faced with 
challenges when it comes to prioritizing issues and inquiries, organizing 
documents and contracts, and collecting payments, whereas tenants do not have an 
effective way to address and resolve liveability issues with the landlord. \\

Landlords have a responsibility to ensure all vital components of a home are 
fully functional. Tenants are their customers and it is up to the landlord to 
keep them comfortable and content. When landlords receive a high volume of 
requests from tenants, sometimes these requests go ignored or unacknowledged, 
leaving tenants feeling 
frustrated and forgotten. 
In addition, the current payment platform landlords use is slow and difficult 
in today's standards. 
Landlords need a platform that allows for reliable communication and more 
accessible payment options. \\

Tenants also requires a reliable means of communication with other tenants and their 
landlord. Property, financial, and interpersonal issues all need to be addressed 
in a timely manner, or else they will propagate. With a centralized 
platform for planning responsibilities and chores, it would create a systematic 
solution for the tenants. Unfortunately even the most diligent people are limited 
by the communication tools available to them. \\

Developing a new software platform to serve as an intermediate between 
landlords and tenants will improve the quality of communication 
and create a more functional living environment for the occupants.
