%Introduction
\section{Introduction}
This testing report shows the results of both system tests and non-functional tests on the Quarters application. The system tests are reported based on each individual module. Non-functional tests included tests on usability, performance and robustness.

%Automated Testing
\section{Automated Testing}
Automatic testing is being used in this project to unit test various parts of the system. The project's components are broken up into several parts: Client-side JavaScript components, Server-side access and security.
\\ \\
The client side JavaScript is tested every week once a week on an alternate web server using QUnit, a JavaScript unit-testing framework. Unit tests were written for each component to ensure every method does their intended action. The unit tests are rigorously tested to ensure all exceptions are handled.
\\ \\
Server Side access is tested via a Python web crawler. To ensure that ever page is reachable. This is run once a week similarly to the client-side tests. The web crawler also crawls through all available link in a demonstration and checks for broken links. Security also tested within the web crawler by crawling with authentication and without authentication. A predetermined set of pages can only be accessible with out authentication such as the landing page, login and registration.
\\ \\
The unit tests will be updated and modified as more development continues. In practice, these unit tests should ensure that updates to the code base and other changes to the server end do not break the system.


%System Tests
\section{System Tests}
In this section the test cases carried out on each individual module are described. Trivial cases for some modules are not explicitly written out but instead described at a high level. Additional details are provided when necessary.

%5. Non-Functional Tests
\section{Non-Functional Tests}

\subsection{Usability}
The usability of Quarters was evaluated by asking test participants to complete a pre-defined task, as well as a pre- and post-test questionnaire, as outlined in the Test Plan. The participants' performance was measured by the total time to complete the task. The average time of all participants to complete the task on Quarters was measured. ‘Think-aloud’ results provided subjective feedback on the user experience of Quarters. The post-questionnaire provided subjective feedback on Quarters itself.

\subsubsection{Results}
Figure \ref{fig:participants} shows the participants. This data was collected during Task 1. The task completion rate was 100\% for both tasks 2a and 2b, and the average times were both less than 60 seconds. Therefore the success metric stated in the Test Plan was met for completion rate and completion time, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:task2}. Figure \ref{fig:task3} illustrates the results from Task 3. The average response rating for each question is shown.

    \caption{Task 3 Post-Questionnaire Responses.}
    \label{fig:task3}
\end{figure}

\ds{You should make all of your tables in \LaTeX{} to ensure a consistent style.}

\subsubsection{Discussion}
The usability evaluation proved there were many positive aspects of the Quarters user interface. Every participant was able to complete their task, and in an efficient time, regardless of the browser or the device. The straightforward navigation of the application allowed the participants to navigate easily across the web application and communicate quickly, which is a high-level goal of the software. The questionnaire results showed that participants agreed that Quarters was easy and intuitive to use. Based on these usability results, one could infer that the design and implementation support Norman’s Design Principles, as discussed in the Detailed Design document. The participants of the usability test unanimously strongly agreed that they would use the Maintenance Ticketing, File Upload and Notifications features. After testing Quarters, in response to how frequently they would use Quarters, participants either did not change their mind, or said they would use it more frequently relative to what they had stated prior to testing Quarters. Several participants noted during the ‘talk-aloud’ that they could see Quarters solving a lot of issues they experience in their current households. These positive test results prove that Quarters has marketability. \\ \\
Quarters was not without its weaknesses though. Not every participant saw the value in using Quarters on a daily basis and not every participant would recommend Quarters to a friend. Additionally, Quarters performed poorly on questions 5 and 6, which tested the usability of the Chat feature and the Finances feature, respectively. Participants noted during the ‘talk-aloud’ that they could not see a use for the Chat feature when the Bulletin Board allowed them the same functionality. Additionally, they noted that the purpose of the Finances feature was not initially clear. One landlord noted that they saw value in the File Upload feature, but not so much in the other features. Lastly, some users with a keen eye for design noted some glitches or flaws in our interface. \\ \\
 



\subsection{Performance}
To load test our server, we used the free trial of Load Impact(loadimpact.com) to simulate 25 users making requests to the server simultaneously; result is shown in \ref{fig:loadTest}.
\\From the graph, you can see that the load time is fairly consistent as the number of users increase.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{figures/loadtest.JPG}
    \caption{Load Test result}
    \label{fig:loadTest}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Robustness}
Quarters application is tested against various browser and hardware devices to ensure that it will work in all environments.

\end{longtable}

\textbf{Permission}: When the user logs in and select a house, he is assigned a role(admin/member), each role has different permissions, for example, only admin can invite new members into the house. In additional to having different roles, the user can only edit/delete ``contents'' owned by himself.\\

\textbf{Session time out}: Session timed out after 30 minutes of inactivity, in which the user is logged out.

\ds{Something is wrong with your margins. The page number is overwriting text.}

\section{Summary of Changes}
Moving forward, there is room for improvement with regard to the non-functional tests. Removing the Chat feature is something to consider to ensure all of our features collectively integrate well into Quarters. Redesigning the Finances feature or adding more functionality to it may help users understand its purpose more intuitively. Devoting more time and focus to styling would help resolve any design concerns and give the interface a more polished and professional appearance. Hopefully, with these changes, more participants would consider using Quarters more frequently and recommending the application to a friend. The results of the usability test have low external validity; in future usability tests, it would be worthwhile to seek a more diverse testing population outside of a school setting, with more landlords participating. Furthermore, a more complex set of tasks for test participants could give a more accurate reading of the effectiveness and efficiency of our application.

\ds{So what exactly did you / are you planning to change?}
